# About BIASlab

BIASlab is a research team at Eindhoven University of Technology. Our research focuses on nature-inspired ("natural") artificial intelligence technology for engineering applications.
In particular, we are inspired by recent results in theoretical neuroscience (the [Free Energy Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle)) on how the brain perceives, learns and makes decisions through unsupervised real-time interactions with its environment.

Our mission is to translate these ideas to *synthetic* agents that automate the design of signal processing and control systems through unsupervised environmental interactions. Applications range from situated design of multimedia applications (e.g., personalized hearing aid algorithms) to real-time decision making for robots and drones.
