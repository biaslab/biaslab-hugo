# Factor Graph Colloquium

*** PUT THE TITLE IN A BANNNER ***

Welcome to the **Factor Graph Colloquium**, a space where we host and archive online presentations on current research in factor graphs. Information about upcoming talks can be found in the [Agenda](/colloquium/agenda/).

## What are factor graphs?

Factor graphs are graphical models that make the factorization structure of functions explicit, enabling efficient message passing-based inference and optimization algorithms in probabilistic models and beyond. Discover more about factor graphs and message passing-based inference in the [Materials](/colloquium/materials/) section.


## Presentation themes & topics

Through this online colloquium, we aim to bring together researchers from different labs and disciplines to explore and discuss recent work on factor graph methods. Topics range from theoretical foundations and numerical techniques to applications in signal processing, control, communications, and related fields. As a guideline, we plan to host a new colloquium every few months.

### Presentation structure

We usually host a talk on **Wednesday at 2 PM (Central European Time, Amsterdam)**, but adjustments can be made when needed.

A typical presentation is structured as follows:
 - 30-40 minutes: Presentation
 - up to 30 minutes: Discussion

Past talks are archived on our [YouTube channel]().
