abstract = "Ship collision accidents frequently cause casualties and significant property losses. These collisions mainly occur by incorrectly interpreting the intents of other ships' navigators. However, inferring the avoidance intents of other ships is challenging, because the uncertain motions and the long-lasting dynamic interactions during encounters usually obscure the true intents. To address this, we propose a probabilistic graph model to infer the hidden avoidance intent of ships. Specifically, the dynamic encounter evolution is expressed in a model represented by a factor graph, where the intent beliefs are accumulated and propagated over time through message passing in the graph. In the inference procedure, we develop a hybrid Bayesian inference approach, integrating a data-driven component derived from empirical priors fitted to historical data, and a model-driven component capturing the ship's control process. We derive 9 types of intents from naturalistic ship encounters and evaluate the model on a validation split. The quantitative metrics demonstrate that, on average, the proposed procedure can accurately infer the intents 14.04 seconds in advance and outperforms the baseline in macro-averaged recall rate (0.2919) and F1-score (0.2843)."
