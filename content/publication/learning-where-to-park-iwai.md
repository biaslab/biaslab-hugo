abstract = "We consider active inference as a novel approach to the design of synthetic autonomous agents. In order to assess active inference’s feasibility for real-world applications, we developed an agent that controls  a  ground-based  robot.  The  agent  contains  a  generative  dynamic model for the robot’s position and for performance appraisals by an observer of the robot. Our experiments show that the agent is capable ofl earning  the  target  parking  position  from  the  observer’s  feedback  and robustly steer the robot toward the learned target position."
