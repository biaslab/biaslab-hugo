abstract = "We study a context-aware preference learning system that automatically learns user preferences in different environments. The system is based on a Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model and comprises an environmental model and a preference learning system. The environmental model is used to determine the userâ€™s current environment, based on environmental signals. The preference learning system actively learns user preferences through pairwise comparison trials. During these trials, the so-called reference and alternative proposals are generated by the system and presented to a user, who, in his/her turn, indicates the preferred one. We propose a novel inference approach that allows for environmental model per-sonalization and leads to improved system performance. This is achieved by introducing a two-way dependency between environment and preference domains. Our approach is validated through simulations that demonstrate a significant performance improvement with respect to the baseline model."
