abstract = "We propose an active inference agent to identify and control a mechanical system with multiple bodies connected by joints. This agent is constructed from multiple scalar autoregressive model-based agents, coupled together by virtue of sharing memories. Each subagent infers parameters through Bayesian filtering and controls by minimizing expected free energy over a finite time horizon. We demonstrate that a coupled agent of this kind is able to learn the dynamics of a double mass-spring-damper system, and drive it to a desired position through a balance of explorative and exploitative actions. It outperforms the uncoupled subagents in terms of surprise and goal alignment."
