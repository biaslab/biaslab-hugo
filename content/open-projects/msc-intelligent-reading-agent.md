## Context

{{< figure src="/img/biaslab-logo.png" title="BIASlab logo" class="right-inline" width="200px" >}}

**BIASlab** (Fig.1, <http://biaslab.github.io>, FLUX-7.060) is
a subgroup of the Signal Processing Systems (SPS) that aims to develop
**Intelligent Autonomous Agents** (IA). These agents interact with their
environment through their sensors and actuators in order to learn
purposeful behavior, e.g., to navigate, play soccer or they may learn to
decode speech signals under bad acoustic conditions. Our research
projects are inspired by the latest insights from machine learning,
computational neuroscience and signal processing.

## Project Description

{{< figure src="/img/proposals/hierachical-brain-processing.jpg" title="hierachical-brain-processing" class="left-inline" width="400px" >}}



In this project you are challenged to develop a software demonstrator for an intelligent agent that learns how to read text. Text reading by humans does not proceed by scanning character sequences in the same order as they appear in the text. Rather, the look direction for the eyes is continually updated to maximize information gain, i.e., to maximally resolve uncertainty about the textual contents. This kind of reading process requires **intelligent dynamical hierarchical reasoning at various levels (characters, words, sentences, etc.)**, see Figure (from: Friston K., Hierarchical Models in the Brain, PLoS Comput Biol 4(11), 2008). In this project, we combine insights from diverse fields such as computational neuroscience, machine learning and signal processing and develop a software demonstrator for an intelligent reading agent. The agent senses images of characters and controls the look direction for the eyes to scan for the next character. The project is ideally suited for a student who wants to learn about **neuroscience-inspired machine learning** techniques. You will get ample support and time to develop your knowledge of biological intelligent systems and how to translate those insights to engineering systems.


## Timing

Start date: the project is available from **April 2018** (or any time thereafter).

Duration: 9 months (fte).

## Financial Support

{{< figure src="/img/proposals/GN-logo.png" class="left-inline" width="100px" >}}

The audio solutions company GN (<http://www.gn.com/>) may financially support strong candidates (qualifications to be discussed with prof. de Vries) by a **GN scholarship**.

## Contact

For more information about this project, please contact Prof. Bert de
Vries (<bert.de.vries@tue.nl>). Also, feel free to make an appointment
to discuss alternative projects with intelligent autonomous agents that
you might be interested in.
