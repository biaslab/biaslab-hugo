Raaja joined as a guest researcher in April 2023 at the Bayesian Intelligent Autonomous Systems Lab (BIASlab) at Eindhoven University of Technology.
He is currently working towards a PhD degree in the Signal Processing Systems group under the supervision of Professor Bert de Vries.
His research focuses on bridging the gap between theory and practice in utilizing Bayesian inference for identifying and controlling large-scale high-precision systems.

He has been working for <a href="https://www.asml.com/en">ASML</a> in the Metrology department since November 2017, where his current role is as an architect with a primary focus on modeling and controlling spatial-temporal systems.
