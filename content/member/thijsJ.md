I am a PhD candidate in BIASlab at Eindhoven University of Technology's Electrical Engineering department. I have a background in mathematics, and I am interested in both practical and philosophical aspects of thinking machines, which include efficiently approximating Bayesian inference, the value loading problem and theory of mind. Outside my work, I enjoy acting, playing the guitar and watching arthouse films.
