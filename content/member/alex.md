I earned my MSc in Cognitive Robotics from TU Delft in 2024, defending a masters thesis demonstrating the ability of a predictive-coding inspired neural network, PredNet, to perform rudimentary structure learning over objects, classes, and class-specific behaviors by way of accurate future video-frame predictions when trained on a custom dataset of video sequences showcasing simple 2D objects and their class-specific behaviors. Now I am a PhD student working jointly under [EE/BIASlab](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research-groups/signal-processing-systems/biaslab), [ME/Reshape Lab](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research-groups/robotics/haptics-and-soft-robotics), and [ME/Neuromorphic Engineering](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research-groups/microsystems/neuromorphic-engineering) groups to enable embodied AI for continuous human-like learning. The minimum expectation is to demonstrate this continuous human-like learning, powered by the neuroscience theory of active inference and implmented in a distributed manner via neuromorphic computing, in a soft-robotics environment exploration and modelling task. More ambitiously, I aim to pave the way towards general, scalable, multisensory, and structurally-grounded modelling and prediction applications.
