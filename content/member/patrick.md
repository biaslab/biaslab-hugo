Patrick Wijnings got his MSc in Electrical Engineering at [Eindhoven University of Technology](http://tue.nl) in 2015. Since 2011 he has been working (part time) at [Sorama](http://sorama.eu) as System Engineer, where he helped develop the hardware and real-time signal processing core used in [the largest microphone array in the world](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-microphone-array/). Since July 2017 he is pursuing his PhD at [Eindhoven University of Technology](http://tue.nl) in collaboration with [BIASlab](http://biaslab.github.io) and [Sorama](http://sorama.eu). His research interests are Bayesian inverse acoustics for large microphone arrays, and the accompanying problem of approximate inference for high-dimensional models.
