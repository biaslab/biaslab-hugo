My general long-term research goal is to develop fully autonomous agents that can solve real-world problems.
Specifically, I aim to build agents that can control robots to automatically perform tasks, thus reducing the workload that was previously handled by humans.
In order for the agent to become fully autonomous, it must be able to make decisions in real-time.
Often, such decisions must be made under uncertainty due to numerous unknown factors in its dynamic environment.
In high-risk applications such as robotics, the agent's decision-making process must also be safe and explainable.

Currently, my work as a PhD student at TU/e focuses on designing the artificial intelligence behind these agents, which is a multi-disciplinary endeavor.
My research involves combining knowledge from (Bayesian) machine learning with theories from neuroscience to develop such intelligence.
The resulting agents should then be able to learn and act similarly to humans, while their decision-making is both safe and explainable.
To demonstrate the capabilities of these agents, their methods will be implemented on a quadrepedal walking robot as part of the [FEP Quad](https://wmkouw.github.io/project/fep-quad/) project.

Previously, I worked as a research scientist at Fraunhofer on improving automated driver assistance systems for autonomous vehicles by employing deep reinforcement learning methods.
