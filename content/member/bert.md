Bert de Vries received MSc (1986) and PhD (1991) degrees in Electrical Engineering from [Eindhoven University of Technology](http://tue.nl) (TU/e) and the [University of Florida](http://ufl.edu), respectively. From 1992 until 1999 he worked at [Sarnoff Research Center](https://www.sri.com/) in Princeton (NJ), where he contributed to research projects over a wide range of signal and image processing topics such as word spotting, financial market prediction, and breast cancer detection from mammograms. Since April 1999 he has been employed in the hearing aids industry (currently at [GN Hearing](http://gnhearing.com)), both in research and managerial roles. Since January 2012 he is also a full professor at the Signal Processing Systems Group at TU/e, where he teaches a [course on Bayesian machine learning](http://bmlip.nl) to graduate electrical engineering students. At TU/e he directs the [BIASlab](http://biaslab.github.io) research team of graduate students with whom he conducts [research on transferring
 a Bayesian brain theory (the Free Energy Principle) to practical engineering](https://youtu.be/QYbcm6G_wsk).
