Wouter Nuijten is a PhD candidate in the SPS group at Eindhoven University of Technology's Electrical Engineering department. His research focuses on the study of nested Active Inference and the emergence of intelligence within complex hierarchical systems. The goal of this research is to design intelligent agents that minimize variational free energy in a control setting.
