I received a BSc degree in Computer Science from the University of Isfahan in 2017. And an MSc degree in Artificial Intelligence, from the Isfahan University of Technology, in 2020. Currently, I am a PhD candidate in the SPS group of the Electrical Engineering department at the Eindhoven University of Technology.
Previously, I worked as an AI researcher and Engineer for two years on improving AI-based projects, including a Real-time panic detection system based on EEG signals and a data analysis system based on dairy farming data.
My research interests focus on the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Bayesian machine learning, and probabilistic programming.
